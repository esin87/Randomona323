# Randomona323 üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Randomona is the brainchild of [Kenny Cruz](https://github.com/knnyczr), and Randomona323 is inspired by his repo for the original [Randomona](https://github.com/knnyczr/RandoMona).

Randomona is a chat bot built on the [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) framework. It was initially generated by [generator-hubot](https://github.com/hubotio/generator-hubot), and configured to be deployed on [Heroku](heroku.com).

This version of Randomona, Randomona323, was created for the SEIR-323 cohort in hopes of creating automated systems through Slack using Hubot's Slack adapter.

## Randomona323 Commands

With Randomona323 added to the private channel you can `@Randomona323` and use the following commands to obtain a response.

### Random Student

When picking a random student Randomona you can `@Randomona323` the following commands: <br>

`random one` <br>
`pick one` <br>
`one` <br>

> This command will look into a neighboring file called `students.js` that holds this SEIR cohort's current student list

### Say Hi

To receive a friendly greeting, you can `@Randomona323` the following commands: <br>

`hi` <br>
`hello` <br>

### Time

This is a hubot built-in feature. Randomona323 is always **waiting** for the following commands: <br>

`time` <br>

> This gives the server's time where RandoMona's instance was created. <br>
> The response looks like: `Server time is: Thu Oct 10 2019 00:20:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)`

## Acknowledgement

A huge shout out to my instructor [Kenny Cruz](https://github.com/knnyczr) for taking the time to teach me how he built his Slackbot, so that Randomona's legacy can continue down to future SEIR cohorts. ‚ù§Ô∏è
